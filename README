Customer Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment generally refers to feelings, attitudes, emotions, and opinions. Sentiment analysis, therefore, is the application of natural language processing (NLP) and text analytics techniques to identify and extract subjective information from a piece of text. In the digital realm, it is the automated process of uncovering emotions regarding how customers feel about a product, brand, or service—whether it belongs to your company or a competitor—on social media platforms. In terms of marketing management, sentiment analysis can be extremely beneficial for established companies to gain insights and respond effectively to their consumers, as well as for startups to understand the dynamics of their market and better position themselves among competitors.

The most common use of sentiment analysis is to classify text into different categories. This typically involves one of the following statistical models:

Naive Bayes
Linear Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Deep Learning
In this notebook collection, we will explore the significance of such analysis and the methods used to conduct it.
